NAME
    Test::EOFNewlines - Check correct end of files in your project.

SYNOPSIS
      use Test::EOFNewlines;

      all_perl_files_ok('lib/Test::EOFNewlines', { minimum_newlines => 2 });

      done_testing();

DESCRIPTION
    Deprecated. Renamed Test::EOF. This distribution will soon be removed.

    This module is used to check the end of files of Perl modules and
    scripts. It is a way to make sure that files and with (at least) one
    line break.

    It assumes that only "\n" are used as line breaks. You might want to
    check if your files contains any faulty line breaks, use Test::EOL for
    that first.

    There is only one function:

  all_perl_files_ok
        all_perl_files_ok(@directories, { minimum_newlines => 1, maximum_newlines => 2 })

    Checks all Perl files (basically "*.pm" and "*.pl") in @directories and
    sub-directories. If @directories is empty the default is the parent of
    the current directory.

    "minimum_newlines => $minimum"

    Default: 1

    Sets the number of consecutive newlines that files checked at least
    should end with.

    "maximum_newlines => $maximum"

    Default: "miminum_newlines"

    Sets the number of consecutive newlines that files checked at most
    should end with.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    Test::EOL was used as an inspiration.
